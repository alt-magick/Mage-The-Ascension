# Alternate Mage: The Ascension Rules


Mage: The Ascension is a roleplaying game set in the World of Darkness, a dark, gothic-punk alternative version of our own reality. In this setting, magic is real but hidden from most people's perception. The game revolves around mages - individuals who can reshape reality through the power of will, belief, and understanding.

The Technocracy stands as a powerful organization seeking to control reality through science, technology, and rational thought. They view magic as a dangerous threat to human progress and work systematically to suppress and eliminate supernatural elements.

The central conflict in Mage: The Ascension is the struggle over the nature of reality itself. Mages fundamentally believe that reality is malleable and can be shaped by human will and belief.

Roleplaying happens inside of scenes. In fact, the entire game exists in scenes. The beauty of roleplaying a scene lies in its uncertainty. Neither the players, or the Storyteller know exactly how the scene will unfold.

A scene is a temporary collaborative reality. A shared imaginative space where individual creativity merges into a collective experience.

Like most role playing games played around a table, we use dice to determine the whims of chance. Anytime a character performs an action under adverse conditions or when the outcome is unclear, his player rolls dice to see whether the task succeeds or fails.

You just need two six sided dice to play. I have changed this from the original game, Mage: The Ascension from rolling a ten sided dice. I did a little math and it just made since.

For a success in this game, rolling a 7 or 11 with two 6 sided dice has the odds of 2/9 which is 0.2222.

A typical success in Mage is made by rolling a 8, 9, or 10 on one 10 sided die, which has the odds of 3/10 which is 0.3.

So, with a few other modifications the game mechanics are basically the same.
<br>
<br>
### Attributes and Skills


Characters possess a variety of traits, describing their innate capabilities, trained skills, and even how many wounds they can suffer before dying. Two types of trait are especially important: Attributes and Skills. Each of these traits is rated in dots (●), ranging from 1 to 5, much like the five-star system many critics use to rate movies. For example, a character might have a Dexterity Attribute of ●●● (3 dots) and a Firearms Skill of ●● (2 dots).

Whenever your character performs an action that calls for dice rolls, you most often add the most appropriate Attribute to the most appropriate Skill. When your character shoots a gun, you add his Dexterity to his Firearms for a total number of dice rolls.
<br>
<br>
### Modifiers


Various conditions and circumstances can greatly improve or hinder your characters tasks, represented by bonuses and/or penalties to your dice rolls. On one hand, quality tools might give him a bonus to repair a car. On the other hand, a thunderstorm might cause hazardous driving conditions, levying a penalty on any driving rolls, and a distant target is hard to hit with a gun, represented by range penalties.

For example, when shooting a target 30 yards away with his Glock 17 pistol, your character suffers a -2 penalty.

The Storyteller determines whether or not any circumstance imposes dice-roll modifiers and how great those modifiers are.
<br>
<br>
### Dice Rolls


So, we can say that that the number of times you get to roll the dice is determined like so: Attribute + Skill + modifiers (if any) In general, bonuses are always added before penalties are applied.
<br>
<br>
### Rolling the Dice


Now that you know what to roll, lets see how to read the results. Each roll uses two dice, and a result of 7, or 11 is considered a success. You might have more than one of these, in which case you have multiple successes. The dice don't just tell you whether your character succeeds or fails it shows you how well he does. If none of your die rolls succeed, your roll fails. Obviously, the more die rolls you have the better your characters chances of success, and the greater your odds of gaining multiple successes.
<br>
<br>
### Snake Eyes


If one of your rolls turn up snake eyes, it cancels out one success. If you roll snake eyes, and none of you other rolls succeed it is a botch.
<br>
<br>
### Second Tries

When a roll fails, you can try again with a +1 difficulty modifier.
<br>
<br>
### Fighting


Combat is a series of die rolls, until someone surrenders or is rendered unable to fight. The rolls determine whether or not your character hits and how much damage he inflicts on his target. The number of dice rolls is determined as above, but a knife is more deadly than a fist, and a gun is more deadly than all. Each success gained on your attack roll represents a point of damage inflicted against the targets Health trait. If the target has no more Health left, he is unconscious or dead (depending on the type of damage done).

There are two types of damage: bashing (caused by blunt weapons such as fists or clubs; these wounds heal quickly), lethal (caused by sharp weapons such as knives and bullets; these wounds heal slowly). There are a number of complications involved in combat, such as a targets Defense Rolls, which are subtracted from any attack successes targeted against him.
<br>
<br>
### Actions


The number of times you roll for an action is made up of an attribute added to an ability. Each of these are given a rating from 1 to five:
<br>

1) Poor

2) Average

3) Good

4) Exceptional

5) World Class
<br>

That dice pool is then modified by one of these levels:
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;+1) Easy

&nbsp;&nbsp;+0) Routine

&nbsp;&nbsp;-1) Moderate

&nbsp;&nbsp;-2) Difficult

&nbsp;&nbsp;-3) Challenging

&nbsp;&nbsp;-4) Hard

&nbsp;&nbsp;-5) Exceptional

<br>


The number of successes you have is also given a rating from one to five:
<br>

1) Marginal

2) Moderate

3) Good

4) Excellent

5) Phenomenal
<br><br>

### Getting Started

Now that you know the basics of the Storytelling System, you can proceed to create your own characters. You’ll be able to judge what sort of traits you’ll need based on their titles (they’re mostly self-explanatory), and know that the more dots you have in a trait the better your character will be when accomplishing tasks with it.


Here is a quick overview of how to begin the character creation process:


The 3 categories of attributes are divided into 3 levels of points: 7/5/3

The 3 categories of abilities are also divided into 3 levels of points: 13/9/5

You get 7 points to go into Backgrounds.

You also get 6 dots that can go into your Mage's magical knowledge called Spheres. The catch is that none of them can be higher than your level of Arete.

Arete starts at 1 and can’t begin higher than 3.

Willpower starts at 5 and can’t begin higher than 7.
<br>

You also get 15 Freebie Points:

To increase an Attribute requires 5 freebie points.

To increase an Ability requires 2 freebie points.

To increase a Background requires 1 freebie point.

To increase Willpower requires 1 freebie point.

To increase Arete requires 4 freebie points.

To increase a Sphere requires 7 freebie points.
<br>

#### Prioritize the categories with 3 levels of points

#### Select Attributes (7/5/3)

* Physical: Strength, Dexterity, Stamina

* Social: Charisma, Manipulation, Appearance

* Mental: Perception, Intelligence, Wits

#### Select Abilities (13/9/5)

* Talents: Alertness, Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Dodge, Expression, Intimidation, Leadership, Streetwise, Subterfuge

* Skills: Crafts, Drive, Etiquette, Firearms, Meditation, Melee, Performance, Stealth, Survival, Technology

* Knowledges: Academics, Computer, Cosmology, Enigmas, Investigation, Law, Linguistics, Medicine, Occult, Science

Additionally, characters also have a number of advantages called Backgrounds.


#### Backgrounds (7):


* Allies - Friends who help you

* Arcane - You are unnoticed as a Mage

* Avatar - The Strength of the soul

* Contacts - Information sources

* Destiny - A greater purpose

* Dream - Visions from the unknown

* Influence - Pull over the mortal world

* Library - Access to metaphysical knowledge

* Node - A place of magical power

* Resources - Extra Money

* Wonder - A Magical talisman or device
<br><br>
### Combat


We will now go over the combat system. It is very simple.

Combat is broken down into three steps, Initiative, Attack, and Resolution.
<br>

#### Stage one - Initiative


During initiative, both players roll Dexterity + Wits. Whoever has more successes gets to go first.

Each player declares either to attack or defend.

It is also possible to ambush someone with: Dexterity + Stealth vs Perception + Alertness
<br>

#### Stage two - Attack


The attacker rolls one of these:

Unarmed Combat: Strength + Brawl

Armed Combat: Strength + Weaponry

Firearms: Dexterity + Firearms

Throwing Objects: Dexterity + Athletics

Then the defender either takes the hit, or if they chose to defend they roll:

Block: Dexterity + Brawl

Dodge: Dexterity + Dodge

Parry: Dexterity + Melee

The successes of the attack roll minus the defense roll equals damage, which is either Bashing or Lethal.

If a weapon is being used the storyteller can increase the modifier for an attack by up to +4. Some guns allow you to shoot multiple times in a turn.
<br>

#### Stage three - Resolution


Roll as many times as your Stamina points to eliminate a point of bashing damage for each success.

If the fighting continues you roll again for initiative.
<br>

Keep track of the damage to your health with this chart:
<br>

#### Health


1) Bruised -0

2) Hurt -1

3) Injured -2

4) Wounded -3

5) Mauled -4

6) Crippled -5

7) Unconscious


Each point of damage is marked with a / for bashing damage and an X for lethal damage. If you acquire 7 bashing damage you are unconscious, further bashing damage can become lethal damage. Either way, you apply a penalty to everything you roll as the damage goes up.If you acquire more than 7 in lethal damage, you can die.
<br>

Finally, your character needs to learn magic!
<br><br>
### Magic


There are 12 Spheres in this system that are divided into coincidental & vulgar magic. The first three levels of each sphere are limited to coincidental effects, and the highest levels of the sphere are divided into two levels of more advanced magic.


The Twelve Spheres in alphabetical order are:


Control, Destruction, Feeling, Influence, Penetration, Production, Revelation, Restoration, Transformation, Travel, Understanding, and Vanishing


These are the degrees of power for the Spheres:
<br>

#### 1) Awareness

* Allows the Mage to sense things with their magic.


#### 2) Sympathetic


* The Mage can effect things they’re personally connected to.


#### 3) Coincidental


* The Mage can work magic as long as it doesn’t defy physics.


#### 4) Manipulative


* The Mage can manipulate and bend the laws of physics.


#### 5) Miraculous

* The Mage can now create impossible miracles.
<br><br>
### Mechanics


#### Casting Magic


* You can only cast magic up to the level of your sphere. Arete is the number of dice to roll when casting a spell. No Sphere can be higher than your level of Arete. A mage can optionally roll fewer dice to avoid a potential botch.


#### Avatar


* A Mage’s Avatar is the maximum Quintessence they can store.



#### Quintessence


* Quintessence is the power source for Magic. Spending Quintessence points reduces the difficulty of a spell, up to your level of Arete. Meditation is required to regain Quintessence for at least an hour at a place of power. The maximum Quintessence a Mage can store is their Avatar score. Quintessence can also be stored in things that are carried by a Mage.



#### Willpower


* One point of willpower generates 1 success

* Willpower can resist mind magic

* Willpower can fight Quiet

* Willpower can ignore penalties from fear & damage

* Willpower can be regained after role play



#### Difficulty


* The difficulty for casting magic is the level of the sphere you are using. Add +1 for Vulgar magic, if there are no witnesses. Add another +1 if a Sleeper witnesses it.



#### Bonuses


* If you have time to do a ritual, Intelligence + Occult can be rolled. Successes are added to your Arete roll up to a +3. If there isn't time for a full ritual, magical tools can add a +1 bonus.



#### Successes


* Simple magic requires only one success, two successes are required for more powerful magic, and larger effects can take even more.



#### Botches


* If a Mage rolls a failure when casting a spell & they also roll snake eyes on any of their dice then they botch. This is a dangerous situation.

### Paradox & Quiet


The official rules say Paradox is caused by Vulgar magic. In these alternative rules Paradox happens when a Mage fails at casting their spells. When a Mage fails a magic roll they gain a Paradox point. A botched roll will then releases that Paradox in the form of a Quiet (Insanity).
<br>

If a Mage has a Paradox level of 1-3, the Quiet happens in one of three ways:

Hallucinations, Fixations, or Depression

If they have a Paradox level of 4-6, the Quiet happens in three more ways:

Delusions & Mood Swings, Repetitive Behaviors, or Suicidal Thoughts

If they have a Paradox level of 7-10, the Quiet happens as:

Wild Hallucinations, Compulsions, and Anti-Social Behavior

If they have a Paradox level of 11+, the Quiet happens in more severe ways:

Complete Madness, Obsession, or Violence

Quintessence can be spent to reduce Paradox, but it has to be done before the Insanity of Quiet occurs. If Paradox reaches a level greater than 10 it is released automatically.
<br><br>
### Occult


This system of magic can connect to occult themes, for interesting role playing.

There are 12 Spheres in this system. Each Sphere connects to one of the 12 signs of the Zodiac. And each Zodiac sign connects to one of 10 planets in Astrology. The 10 planets and 12 signs connect with the 22 Major Arcana of the Tarot.
