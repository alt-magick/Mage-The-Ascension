<BR>
This is an alternate system of sphere magic for the World of Darkness. It replaces the spheres for Mage: The Ascension.<br><br>

The Twelve Spheres in alphabetical order are:<br><br> 
Control, Destruction, Feeling, Influence, Penetration, Production, Revelation, Restoration, Transformation, Travel, Understanding, and Vanishing.
<br><br>
These are the degrees of power for the Spheres:<br><br>
<pre>
•	Awareness
••	Sympathetic
•••	Coincidental
••••	Manipulative
•••••	Miraculous
</pre>
<br>
• Awarenes<br><br> Allows the Mage to sense things with their magic.<br><br>
• Sympathetic<br><br> The Mage can effect things they're personally connected to.<br><br>
• Coincidental<br><br>The Mage can work magic as long as it doesn't defy physics.<br><br>
• Manipulative<br><br>The Mage can manipulate and bend the laws of physics.<br><br>
• Miraculous<br><br>The Mage can now create impossible miracles.<br>
<br>

# Mechanics
<br>
These rules are just a few notes from the Mage: The Ascension rule book.<br><br>
• Arete<br><br> Arete is the Mage's level of enlightenment. In game terms it is the number of dice a Mage rolls when casting their spells. No Sphere can be higher than your level of Arete. You can also only spend up to your level of Arete in quintessence on a single spell. A mage can optionally roll less dice than their Arete to avoid a potential botch.<br><br>
• Avatar<br><br> A Mage's Avatar is the maximum  Quintessence they can store.<br><br>
• Quintessence<br><br>Quintessence is the power source for Magic. Spending Quintessence reduces the difficulty of a spell, up to a modifier of -3. Meditation is required to regain Quintessence for at least an hour at a place of power. Quintessence can also be stored in things that are carried by a Mage.<br><br>
• Willpower<br><br>By spending a point of willpower Mages gets an automatic success on their spells. Willpower is tough to regenerate and can be useful for more than Magic.<br><br>
• Difficulty<br><br>The difficulty of a spell is the level of the Sphere you are using. You then add +3 for coincidental magic, and +4 for Vulgar magic if there are no witnesses. Add +5 for Vulgar magic witnessed by Sleepers.<br><br>
• Successes<br><br>Simple magic requires only one success, two successes are required for more powerful magic, and larger effects can take even more. If your level of Arete is at least one point higher than the Sphere you are using, you can succeed without a dice roll.<br><br>
• Botches<br><br>If a Mage rolls a failure when casting a spell & they also roll a 1 on any of their dice then they botch. This is a dangerous situation.<br><br>

# Paradox & Quiet
<br>
The official rules say Paradox is caused by Vulgar magic. In these alternative rules Paradox happens when a Mage fails at casting their spells.<br><br>

When a Mage fails a magic roll they gain a Paradox point. A botched roll will then releases that Paradox in the form of a Quiet (Insanity).<br><br>
If a Mage has a Paradox level of 1-3, the Quiet happens in one of three ways:<br><br>
Hallucinations, Fixations, or Attraction to Death<br><br>
If they have a Paradox level of 4-6, the Quiet happens in three more ways:<br><br>
Delusions & Mood Swings, Reoccurring Behavior Patterns, or Morbidity<br><br>
If they have a Paradox level of 7-10, the Quiet happens as:<br><br>
Wild Hallucinations, Obsession, and Anti-Social Behavior<br><br>
If they have a Paradox level of 11+, the Quiet happens in more severe ways:<br><br>
Complete Madness, Living a Repetitive Loop, or Becoming a Serial Killer<br><br>
Quintessence can be spent to reduce Paradox, but it has to be done before the Insanity of Quiet occurs. If Paradox reaches a level greater than 10 it is released automatically.
