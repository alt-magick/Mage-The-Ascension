# Paradox & Quiet
<br>
The official rules say Paradox is caused by Vulgar magic. In these alternative rules Paradox happens when a Mage fails at casting their spells.<br><br>

When a Mage fails a magic roll they gain a Paradox point. A botched roll will then releases that Paradox in the form of a Quiet (Insanity).<br><br>
If a Mage has a Paradox level of 1-3, the Quiet happens in one of three ways:<br><br>
Hallucinations, Fixations, or Depression<br><br>
If they have a Paradox level of 4-6, the Quiet happens in three more ways:<br><br>
Delusions & Mood Swings, Reoccurring Behavior Patterns, or Suicidal Thoughts<br><br>
If they have a Paradox level of 7-10, the Quiet happens as:<br><br>
Wild Hallucinations, Compulsions, and Anti-Social Behavior<br><br>
If they have a Paradox level of 11+, the Quiet happens in more severe ways:<br><br>
Complete Madness, Obsession, or Violence<br><br>
Quintessence can be spent to reduce Paradox, but it has to be done before the Insanity of Quiet occurs. If Paradox reaches a level greater than 10 it is released automatically.
